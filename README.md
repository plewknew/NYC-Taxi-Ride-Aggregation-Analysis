# NYC Taxi Ride-Aggregation Analysis
A notebook proposing an algorithm to historically analyze the impact of ride aggregation for New York taxis.

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a way of looking back on taxi ride data to understand the impact of aggregated ridesharing. The goal is to understand the potential impact on NYC traffic congestion and passenger savings if every ride in NYC was aggregated with other close rides. A way of thinking about ride aggregation is similar to Uber Pool, wherein users of the app will join other, random, users of the app to take a ride together. 

The notebook will go through data cleaning, implement a custom algorithm for the data in order to aggregate data, and go through some basic visualizations for the impact that ride aggregation has on congestion and passenger savings. This is meant to be a jumping off point for additional analysis.
